# SwiftUI Photo Gallery App

A simple iOS application built with **SwiftUI** that displays a collection of photos in a list or grid. Users can tap on a photo to view it in full-screen mode with pinch-to-zoom functionality. The app uses **URLSession** for network calls and **Combine** for reactive programming.

## Architecture

- **SwiftUI**: Declarative UI for both grid and full-screen views.
- **Combine**: Handles network requests and state updates.
- **MVVM Pattern**:
  - `HomeViewModel`: Manages photo fetching and state.
  - `FullScreenPhotoViewModel`: Handles photo saving and messages.
- `PhotoSaverService`: Responsible for saving images to the photo library.
